### Pharma Supply Chain Management (PSCM)

To understand this, let's break it down into two parts: Pharma (pharmaceutical) and supply chain management.
Supply chain management is defined as “the amalgamation of key business processes across the supply chain for the rationale of generating value and reliable products for customers and stakeholders.”
Recently, in Africa, 66 fatalities have been reported as a result of a new cough syrup manufactured by an Indian pharmaceutical company called Maiden pharmaceuticals. 
Given that the company has enormous international influence, adversarial enterprises and hostile firms may have compromised its supply chain.
So, to make the supply chain system more dependable without human error and felonious payoffs, we have to create a system that can identify even the smallest error.
This website aims to integrate pharmaceuticals’ supply chain management with Blockchain (to give pharmaceutical traceability and immutability)  and spot/QR codes (to provide identity into the blockchain).

=> User analysis:
<br>
a. Businesses that produce pharmaceuticals. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. transport medications. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. storage, and label these medications. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. raw material supply. <br>
b. Government officials who certify these drugs. <br>
c.  Retailers like pharmacies and hospitals that purchase these drugs. <br>
d. The people who purchase these medications. <br>

<ul>
<li>The User webpage ought to contain a search bar for looking up certain products, and it ought to 
provide all the data in an easily digestible tabular manner. <li> 
<li>The producer webpage should have an update option that allows users to update the new supply 
and, if necessary, review any prior updates, Storage locations, and transport transparency. <li> 
<li> All new updates made by manufacturers should have approved options on the government officials'
webpage, and users and pharmaceuticals should be able to see their ID so they can trust the source. <li> 
<li> Pharmacies should see a record of their purchases, travel agency contacts, expiry date of stock,
name, and count of medicines they own, and buyer details. <li> 
<ul>

=> System prototyping:
<br>
The idea is to make the whole supply chain process transparent in such a way that any person can the status of a particular medicine.

=> Interface evaluation:
<br>
The goal of this evaluation is to decide the usability, and intuitive for users. The evaluation   strategy for my website is, <br>
      &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; | Requirements -> Design -> Construction -> Testing -. Production | <br>
